      summary: Provision WhatsApp deployment
      description: "This API request provisions a WhatsApp cluster. Once provisioned, the cluster progresses through the following deployment stages: `INITIALIZING`, `CREATING_CLUSTER` and `CLUSTER_CREATED`. When the `CLUSTER_CREATED` stage is reached an OTP voice call or SMS is sent to the specified number and the deployment status becomes `CODE_SENT`. When the OTP is received, call the Verify API to complete the process."
